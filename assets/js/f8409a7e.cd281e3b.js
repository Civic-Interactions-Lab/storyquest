To foster inclusion and engagement, we\nhave developed StoryQuest, an interactive, story-based "Mad Libs" style game that promotes collaboration, literacy development,\nand turn-taking skills. The game leverages the cloze phrase technique, a proven method in speech\ntherapy that helps children improve language skills, word recall, and structured communication. Through team-based gameplay,\nplayers take turns contributing words to a shared story, encouraging social interaction, cognitive development, and\nproblem-solving. By integrating AAC tools, structured repetition, and adaptive difficulty levels, StoryQuest ensures that\nall players\u2014regardless of communication ability\u2014can participate meaningfully, keep learning, and most importantly, have fun!'})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>s});var o=n(96540);const a={},i=o.createContext(a);function r(e){const t=o.useContext(i);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:r(e.components),o.createElement(i.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
